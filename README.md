This project turns the legendary **Breaking Bad** into data storytelling.  
Using Tableau, I transformed raw episode data into an **interactive dashboard** that narrates the series — from viewership spikes to top-rated episodes, directors, and runtime insights.

## ✨ Why This Repo is Different
Most Tableau repos just drop a workbook or link.  
This one is designed as a **storytelling artifact**:  
- ASCII wireframe for structure clarity  
- Episode-level insights (not just charts)  
- Thematic branding (“Say My Data”) aligned with Breaking Bad’s iconic lines  

It’s not just a dashboard — it’s **data cooked the Heisenberg way**.
